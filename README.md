# My Personal Site

Welcome to my personal site. This is just a fun way for me to share a bit about myself while practicing basic web development skills. The making of this site involved:

-HTML5, CSS3/Bootstrap, Javascript/jQuery
-fetching blog posts from Medium RSS and using rss2json API to display dynamically
-Instagram API to display some pictures
-Spotify API to run a radio station
-Soundcloud API to show my recently reposted tracks
