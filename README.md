# My Personal Site

Welcome to my personal site. This is just a fun way for me to share a bit about myself while practicing basic web development skills. The making of this site involved:  

-HTML5, CSS3/Bootstrap, Javascript/jQuery<br /> 
-fetching blog posts from Medium RSS and using rss2json API to display dynamically<br />
-Instagram API to display some pictures<br />
-Spotify and Soundcloud player widgets for playlists<br />
